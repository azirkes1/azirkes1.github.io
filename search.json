Users select the data layers and data format they are interested in and draw a boundary on the map. The output is either a tif file or pdf map of the data clipped to their boundary.\n Key skills: Python, ArcGIS Pro, automated geoprocessing, data cleaning & visualization, creative problem solving Python modules utilized: streamlit, folium, numpy, rasterio, matplotlib, and geopandas\nClick here to view the app\nClick here to view the github repository\n\n\nWildfire Management App interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose ×\n\nBurn Severity and Vegetation Recovery Tool\nAlongside the Wildfire Management Data App, I also developed Google Earth Engine code to help land managers in Bristol Bay, Alaska assess burn severity and vegetation recovery after wildfires. This code uses Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery to calculate the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and the differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI). In addition, I recorded a tutorial as this tool is intended for users who have little to no experience with Google Earth Engine.\n\nKey skills: JavaScript, Google Earth Engine, satellite image processing, remote sensing indices, fire ecology\nClick here to view the code\nClick here to view the tutorial\n \ndNBR output for the Koktuli River fire, which burned in Bristol Bay, Alaska in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose ×\n\nBristol Bay, AK Wildfire StoryMap\nI developed an ArcGIS StoryMap to tell one story of wildfires in Bristol Bay, Alaska and house the Wildfire Mangement Data App and Burn Severity and Vegetation Recovery Tool.\n Key skills: ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS StoryMap, written communication, data mangement\nClick here to view the StoryMap\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose ×\n\nDevon Ice Cap Retreat, Velocity, and Elevation Analysis\nAs a final project during my master’s coursework, I measured the retreat of Devon Ice Cap with SWIR1 band differencing. I used Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine for this analysis. I also analyzed global glacier datasets to investigate changes in velocity and elevation on this ice cap and created visualizations in ArcGIS Pro.\n Key skills: Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS Pro, Remote sensing indices, and data wrangling, management, & visualization\nClick here to read the final report\n\n\nRetreat of Devon Ice Cap 1987 – 2024. Total retreat measured is 617 km2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose ×\n\nArcGIS Wildfire Dashboard + Tutorial\nFor another final project during my master’s coursework I built an ArcGIS Dashboard to track wildfires across the US. I then used this dashboard to film a tutorial about how to use ArcGIS Dashboards.\n\nKey skills: ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboards, oral communication, data visualization\nClick here to view the dashboard\n\n\nWildfire dashboard interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose ×\n\nLiterature Review: Remote Sensing of Permafrost Thaw and Associated Infrastructure Damage Using Very High-Resolution Imagery\n\nI researched the use of remote sensing tools for detecting permafrost thaw and building damage, and synthesized findings in an in-depth literature review as a final project during my master’s coursework.\n\nKey skills: technical writing, interdisciplinary research, organization\nClick here to read the review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose ×\n\nLGBTQ+ Youth Spatial Analysis\nDuring my GIS Certificate coursework, I developed compelling visualizations of Trevor Project data to tell the story of how anti-LGBTQ+ state legislation relates to the LGBTQ+ youth mental health crisis. I created this map using ArcGIS Pro and Adobe Illustrator.\n\nKey skills: ArcGIS Pro, Adobe Illustrator, Cartography, data storytelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose ×\n\nAccess to Green Spaces Analysis\nAs part of my GIS Certificate coursework, I worked in a three-person team to develop a PostgreSQL database and analyze US green space access disparities using ArcGIS Pro.\n\nKey skills: PostgreSQL, ArcGISPro, database design, spatial analysis, team collaboration\nClick here to read the report"

    "text": "I recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Madison with a Master’s in Environmental Observation and Informatics. I am passionate about using geospatial data to create accessible tools and tell stories, especially related to environmental conservation.\nAs for project experience, I spent the summer as a Geospatial Intern with The Nature Conservancy - Alaska working to support communities in Bristol Bay, Alaska with the growing threat of wildfires. While interning, I developed a web app to make crucial wildfire management data more accessible to local communities. I also created Google Earth Engine code to assess burn severity and vegetation recovery of wildfires in the area and wrote an ArcGIS Storymap to tell one story of wildfires in Bristol Bay.\nIn my free time I enjoying just about anything outside - hiking, canoeing, camping, and exploring. As a creative outlet, I also love hand embroidery and quilting.\n\n\n\n\nProfessional and Academic Timeline"
