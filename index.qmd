  I recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Madison with a Master's in Environmental Observation and Informatics. 
  I am passionate about using geospatial data to create accessible tools and tell stories, especially related to environmental conservation.

  As for project experience, I spent the summer as a Geospatial Intern with The Nature Conservancy - Alaska working to support communities in Bristol Bay, Alaska with the growing threat of wildfires. While interning, I developed a web app to make crucial wildfire management data more accessible to local communities. I also created Google Earth Engine code to assess burn severity and vegetation recovery of wildfires in the area and wrote an ArcGIS Storymap to tell one story of wildfires in Bristol Bay.

  In my free time I enjoying just about anything outside - hiking, canoeing, camping, and exploring. As a creative outlet, I also love hand embroidery and quilting.
